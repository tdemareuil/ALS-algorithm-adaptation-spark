Igoe,0/0,1.0,1233360000,Don't buy!,"First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!"

There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success."

But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone."

As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that).

The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest.

The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have."

The eargels make the headset easy to find in your pocket/purse and put in the ear when receiving a call.

I found that the earbuds provided from Aliph did not suit my ear. It was not secure even with the earloop attached. These did the trick. It was a gamble at first since i found barely any reviews on such a product with its compatibility with the New Jawbone, but it worked out for the best. These are not made for the jawbone so you are relying on its snug fit to stay in place. I removed the original eargel and replaced these onto the unit. It is snug enough for me to use without the earloop. Also its design makes the eargel stay in place in your ear. It may be tricky to fit in your ear at first but in time you'll get the feel for it. It fits my ear perfectly with the largest size. As a bonus you get multiple sizes. This is an excellent solution for those that don't have the right ear for the original gels provided for the New Jawbone.On another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel.

I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit.

Also, I don't like using the earloop to hold it in place.This is where the Jabra eargels come in.

2,Jabra EarGels - Clear,9.70,645,Paul S. Toth,1/1,3.0,1262044800,Better than standard earpiecs but not great,"I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says ""what?"" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this."

Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear.

I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through.

2,Jabra EarGels - Clear,9.70,499,"Shannon Lawson ""GS K9""",40/44,3.0,1196812800,Just OK but better than what Jawbone provides,"I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people."
2,Jabra EarGels - Clear,9.70,920,MR JAYPE,19/19,4.0,1212192000,Instructions on how to use with Jawbone,"If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable."

Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet."

You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need."

Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now.."

I had used all of the plug in ear accessories and they work well for short conversations and a short period of time. However, nothing compares to this. You place the phone in the cradle and thats it, it does the rest. While the phone is in the cradle, and the ignition is on, it is being charged. The phone can also be set to answer on its own when a call comes in and it will even mute the radio. I give this an excellent rating."

The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional ""post"" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!"

It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit.

When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels.

The wall wart rarely got used- I'd have to find it, unroll the cord, reach down to plug it into the wall, etc. Not a very handy device. The mobile charger was much more convenient- if I remembered to use it, and if it was in the car I was driving. Oops, left the charger in the van. Oops, forgot to connect it. More than once I arrived at the office with a nearly dead phone.I bought this little stand on a whim, really, but it's turned out to be the single most useful accessory I ever purchased for a cell phone.

75,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Pumpkin Orange) [Motorola Retail Packaging],unknown,791,"John Williamson ""JargonTalk""",2/3,5.0,1220572800,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset in Orange,"Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked ""bulk"" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a ""Motomanual."" From all appearances it was brand new."

Has some minor issues.,"I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is ""on"" or ""off"". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not ""sit"" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did."

It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it."

I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless."

(not sure about other ""hookless"" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a ""beep beep"" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that."

It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????"

It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the ""antenna"" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality."

Sound quality is excellent and it is the only one I can effectively use in the car on the highway, others are just not loud enough.

63,Nextlink AX2 Blue Spoon Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaged],unknown,772,W. J. Kocik Jr.,2/2,2.0,1173312000,Worth about what you pay,"Pros:Pairing was easy. The thing does work, and is usable as an entry-level Bluetooth headset. Loved the mechanism by which it fits in your ear; that's very comfortable and secure at the same time.Cons:You pretty much get what you pay for. It looks nice, but it feels flimsy. When you plug the charger in, it feels like it doesn't fit, or you're putting it in wrong. That isn't a big problem, but it feels like a symptom of a cheaply made product.The performance of the AX2 I received was such that I thought it was defective and I sent it back for an exchange. It seemed like the connection between the headset and the phone was almost always plagued with bad static, the connection was dropped quite often, and people I spoke to while using the headset often complained that they could barely hear me.However, the replacement unit Amazon sent me (kudos to their return process and customer service, by the way) behaved exactly the same way, which tells me that this is just how this model is.In the end, I returned it and bought the just-released Plantronics Discovery 665, with AudioIQ (Amazon sells this, too, but I bought mine from Sprint). The difference is night and day. Of course, the Plantronics also costs several times as much, so it had darn well better perform.Overall, I'd say the AX2 is an okay deal if you buy it at Amazon's discounted price (do not go pay retail for this thing, it isn't nearly worth it and there are dozens of better models at the same price point), and you're only a casual user of the thing. I mean, for the most part it *does* work - just not particularly well."

But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable.

It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it."

For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain."

63,Nextlink AX2 Blue Spoon Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaged],unknown,776,fedward,0/0,4.0,1172275200,I love it so much I've bought two.,"I paid [a dollar amount over twice what Amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if I put it here] for one at [a store the name of which Amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like I did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. Over the years I've tried headsets from AT&T;, Body Glove, Hello Direct, Jabra, and Plantronics, and I find the Bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, Jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and Plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on Earth).The soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). A good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. It weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it IN your ear, not just ON it.Once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. I don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). And once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. I have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.I had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the Bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. The headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. Once I got the phone replaced that problem went away. So if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. It might just be your phone.I bought a second one from Amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- I could turn the volume up, but not down. I've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now I have two that work. I've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.Pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; Bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.Minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.A minus only on paper: no noise reduction. In my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. I'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges."

The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did.

Boyd ""Gadget Geek""",0/0,4.0,1171497600,Pretty good for the money.,"After two weeks of use, I'd have to say it's not that bad... Especially for the price! My Bluetooth 1.1 Sanyo Katana can't get more than 4 or 5 feet away but inside that and the clearity is great both in and out. Battery life is longer than my phone so that a plus. I really like the little tail thingy on the ear piece because it does a good job of securing the headset to my ear. I rarely have to turn the volume up all the way on the headset, and I don't have to speak loudly for the other end to hear me. The tiny size is awsome!The bad:The multi function button tends to shift and rattle a bit and every time I move my head and hear it, I think ""cheap""The flashing blue LED is too bright in the car at night.Wind noise is a problem with this headset.I wouldn't steer anyone away from this headset who is looking for a low priced unit.

63,Nextlink AX2 Blue Spoon Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaged],unknown,5,A. Baumann,0/0,2.0,1168473600,"Good idea, poor execution","I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button ""countersunk"" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't."

The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable..."

It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work.

Wrye ""thomasmarc""",1/1,1.0,1172188800,Who cares how cheap it is if IT DOESN'T WORK!!!,"After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe)."

(thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public.

Extremely lightweight, with secure fit. It's easy to forget you have this on because it is so light. The soft spring easily fits into your ear and secures it. With the hook type headsets, there is some play during side-to-side head movement. This fits snugly in the ear and normal movements do not feel loose or unsecured. You do notice the speaker piece after it's been in your ear for more than a few hours, but it's not painful, just a little sore as there is only one size. I generally don't keep the headset in all day anyway, and only realized it because I had forgotten it was in.2. Incoming sound is very loud. It's in-ear design and fit allows you to hear very well. It's one headset I've used that I actually don't want at full volume.3. Has lots of ways to connect and conference calls. You can control switching from headset to handset from the headset, or connecting more than one call through the buttons.4. The blue talk light turns red when the battery is low, giving you a visual warning.Not so great:1. Lots of static in the bluetooth connection. I have my cellphone on my belt clipped on the left, and use the headset on the right ear. I do tend to notice this more when I am near a wifi source, but not always. I've also noticed it away from wifi signals (like my car). I've had the headset for about a week, and am still trying to figure out why a 3' distance on a 30' BT device would have so much problem with a clear connection.2. While the volume is loud, the sound quality is poor. My Motorola H500 wasn't nearly as loud, so I can't hear well when it's noisy, but the sound quality is much better. The AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies are boosted. While it may make voices easier to hear, it also sounds tinny and unnatural.3. Build quality is very mediocre. It's plastic, and I dropped it from waist level onto the parking lot surface. One of the volume buttons popped off, and the battery compartment was half popped out, as well as the plastic halves loosened. So now I don't have a volume button. I'd heard others say this unit breaks easily, and I can believe it might not have survived a drop from ear level.4. Headset tends to echo, although I don't know if it's worse than other BT sets. My Motorola echoed, but not quite as much as this. I don't notice it, but the person I call will mention it.5. The first day the power on/off tone was clearly audible. I don't know what happened, but after the first day the tone is muted so much I have to listen closely to hear the unit power on or off.I am still on the hunt for my ideal bluetooth set. Will try out the noise cancelling mics or bone conduction technology next because the older mic technology this represents leaves much to be desired."

It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it.

I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one."

This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options."

The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case."

This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force."

I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment."

The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book.

You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX.

It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars.

The Nokia BH-600 has worked well for me. It fits well, looks compact and stays in its place. The battery life could've been better (it gives me about 3 hours of talk-time and ~ 72 hours of standby time) - my techie friend tells me that the battery is compromised for compactness."
68,Nokia BH-600 Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones,unknown,717,Douglas Auchter,0/0,4.0,1207872000,"Great Headset, Poor Fit","This was my first bluetooth headset I purchased, and I made sure I researched it before I bought it. All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution. Great headset."

I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected.

Russell,11/11,4.0,1124582400,Small Phone with Big Features and Big Performance,"First this is a beautiful phone with a beautiful size and a beautiful feature-set targeted for a busy biz type. Features are tri-band for reception, Dictaphone for voice memos, Speakerphone for hands free, and PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar for todo and event alarms with day/wk/mo/yr repeatability on recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take out the trash :), etc.ALL the features work great. Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, and speakerphone, all adjustable. Has a separate power switch on top for quick access to ringer options(one press) or power-off(press and hold)for batt save, etc.It is so small you can wear it in the watch pocket of jeans, in a shirt pocket, or your pants pocket without a bulge. Still, the keypad layout is such that I find it easy to dial because the keys cover the total keyboard, unlike my previous SE T234 small point buttons. For those who derated this phone for its small size, I don't get it? If you want a bigger phone that has bigger keys and a bigger screen, get one for heaven sake. Please rate a phone for its features and performance, not its size. That is a positive for those who want this.Those looking for a well featured small phone with Nokia's quality and RF reception, you will not be disappointed with this one. You will not get a camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, or memory enough for gobs of games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers and video(this is the Nokia 6230i). You will get an excellent and practical communication and organizational device having enough memory for adequate games/ audio/video accessories and the features required for the practical user, and a good price.Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud but adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator and flashing keyboard silent modes, small and VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync with Nokia's free down-loadable SW. Standard barrel-type charger plug.Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, no side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys."

The one thing that really differs with this phone (compared to the three other Nokias I've had over the years) is that these buttons are really small and it can literally be a pain sometimes when you're sending text messages. After owning this phone for nearly a month now, here's what I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has a useful voice recorder* Speakerphone is very useful (esp. if you're driving and don't own a headset)* You can change your right, navigation button to create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly for those that are cell phone challenged* Comes with a sleek travel size charger* If you're a Cingular customer, this got better reviews compared to the fancy-shmancy (and more expensive) Samsung, LG and Ericcson phones they also offer.Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume has a big difference between levels 2 and 3* If you own a headset for older Nokia phones you have (such as a 3595), it won't work with this one. You'll have to splurge and buy a new headset. =(* Ring tones are kind of weak, I'm 30 and it feels like they had teens in mind when creating ringtones for this phone (same thing with the wallpaper options).* Games are cool, but the bowling game is only limited to +/- 5 games before you're denied access.Hope this was useful for anyone interesed in buying this phone. =)"

At first I purchased a Motorola V551, but that gave me poor reception compared with my Samsung E315, which I previously owned. Not wanting an expensive phone that would drop calls frequently, I decided to trade it in for a Nokia, becasue my father used Nokia ever since he started to use cellular services, and he was extremely satisfied. The Nokia 3120 appealed to me because of it's styling. Although it is not as technologically advanced as the phones I was used to, the styling appealied to me, along with the fact that the phone was 39.99. I truly like the styling. It is the best I've seen in the bar phone class. It is not outlandish in any essence. It is a smart phone for people who want basic functionality. What also appeals to me is the user interface. It is the best one I've seen for any phone. It is the smae interface used on all digital nokias, which date back to about 1996, which is when I first was exposed to Nokias. It is extremely simple to use, the most convinient features can be accessed with two or three button pushes. The biggest thing that got me to purchase this phone is it's reception. Better than any phone i've used. I can use it deep inside buildings. My mother has a Nokia 6010, and she can call from the breakroom in her office, which is in the center of the building. All this packed in a sleek, understated enclosure makes this phone very pleaseing.My only complaints about this phone is the lack of ""fun"" features, such as a camera or video playback. If you really want a camera phone, but like what you hear abou this Nokia, the 6230 is for you, and I will buy that in 6-12 months. Another thing I do not like is the color. You can get covers for it, but the middle part of the phone, where all the circuitry and the antenna lie, is pasty white, which for a guy like me, is girly. One of my friends commented exactly. One flaw, though it does not bother me, is the size of the phone. While it is higly portable and compact, the buttons could be too small for some.A summary of pros and cons (some i did not list above)ProsStyling and portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize of keypadlack of ""fun"" features such as camera, although it has a camera attackmentI know this review is very long, but I wanted to cover all aspects of the phone so as not appear bisaed in any direction.

This is not a particularly tough phone. My teenage son killed his within six months. Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it. I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone. If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty. I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right. Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness ""down."" When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling. I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones. Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone.

My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him.

I'm a fairly small individual and I also needed a phone that had to be small enough to fit into my pocket comfortably with no protrusions to gouge me. I did not need a camera or any extraneous features like that. This phone seems to be fitting these criteria perfectly. I was planning on spending quite a bit on a phone to meet those criteria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone was free on my plan.I have dropped it a couple of times from about 10-12 feet up onto concrete and it keeps working just fine. It has slid for about 20 feet across a piece of concrete. It does have some minor scuffs after this but nothing significant. It does not have any buttons on the sides so there is nothing there to have fallen off when it hit the concrete. It has been submersed in a water tank and seems to have come back from it well also.As far as visibility of the display issues that other people have mentioned in their reviews, I have noticed that it has what seems to be a ""power save"" type situation it kicks into where the display is difficult to read. Hitting certain keys seems to kick this ""mode"" off. Other than those situations I have had no more difficulty reading the display than on other candy bar style phones I have had from Nokia.

Fast opening and browsing of menu and sub-menus: 04. Build and keypad spacing: +15. No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5.The other reviewers are right about the screen in sunlight: it sucks. But if you're like me and are chained in a cube for the daylight hours, it doesen't matter that much.The only thing I dislike about this handset, is that it is quite slow in opening its submenus. I would have thought that such a basic, stripped phone would be lightning fast; indeed, it was one of the reasons I bought it, but not so. Gone are the days you could unlock your phone and call a contact within a second.Besides this con, it is solidly built, has exceptional voice quality, and is easy to dial with if you have thick fingers."

Entry level should have a screen you can see in the light and a reliable ringer. Display has no brightness adjust only contrast which is useful for making the screen harder to see not improve. Using any wallpaper but white makes the screen impossible to see/read text even indoors in all but a dark room. Fonts have a setting to enlarge (Nokia knew the screen was junk) text but the small display prevents this. Calls have barely audible sound quality to understand the conversation (not due to signal). Buttons are too small for hands larger than medium-sized fingers and don't always make contact first time. Screen back-light doesn't always light when first button is pressed. When backlight is off screensaver time display is impossible to read when activated. Battery time is good most likely due to screen being dimly lit. User settings are all over the place in a unintuitive fashion making personal settings a time consuming chore instead of one menu.I can do w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc. but to fail in the basic functions of a cell phone is pretty bad & not acceptable.

It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet.

19,LG C1300i Phone (AT&T),unknown,203,"loce_the_wizard ""loce_the_wizard""",18/22,3.0,1102982400,One person's pro might be another's con,"Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon. That night, it stopped working. I won't miss it."

Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few ""cool"" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror.

I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than ""when are you getting home?"" ""seven."" ""okay, see you then."" because you will spend half your time saying, ""wait, can you say that again?"" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better.

It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time.

Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call.

I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna ""upgrade"". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone."

I had mine replace with the ""upgrade"" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off.

It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, ""What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?"" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)"

It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up.

Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to ""flip"" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end.

Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones. It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages. Voicemail doesn't work half the time. There's no voice recorder or loud speaker. You can't see the screen in the sunlight. Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying. There's no snooze on the alarm. The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone. The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time).

91,Sony Ericsson K800i Unlocked Triband Cybershot Phone (Black),unknown,200,Dewgunner,10/10,4.0,1185667200,A Great Little Phone,"I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim. I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance. So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one. I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton . I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i. I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would. I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem. A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package. I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market. Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot."

Remove the Baby Bell service from your home or business, then plug this unit into a phone jack with the cellphone in the cradle. From any phone in your home or business, including cordless phones, you can operate exactly like you always have. The benefit?? You now have all of the features, and plan advantages of your cellular phone. It is great for a small business as the owner can take the phone when they leave, or leave it in place and allow the calls to go to voice mail.There is one potential fault. To place the Nokia phone in the cradle, one sets it into the cradle with the phone vertical. After it latches, it gently leans toward the rear of the unit. I accidently broke one I had because to remove the Nokia phone without damage, you must tilt the phone to the front of the cradle before removal.My only other concern with this device...... I wish Andrew had units available for phones other than the Nokia 5100/6100 and Startac. Once these phones are no longer available, what will we do? I can hope!"

I run all the phones in my house through the Extensis and have saved $20/month (relative to having both cell and landline service) through using this device. It's reliable and allows me to have extension phones throughout the house rather than carrying a cellphone from room to room. Given the fact that increasing numbers of folks are using cellphones as their principal telephone (see New York Times of August 2003) it's surprising that this item has been discontinued and nobody else seems to have picked up on the concept.

I can hear people clearly when I make outbound calls and recieve inbound calls. Loaded with features. Reliable phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have had nothing but problems with them. (Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options."

The buttons are large enough to avoid accidental presses of adjacent keys. There are three, count 'em, three buttons to take pictures. That is probably overkill. This is my first LG phone and I selected it based on the feature set but also because I've been told and read on the web that the phone handles weak signals well. So far that is true.After a horrible experience with the Motorola 720 which dropped calls faster than fall leaves and an experience with Verizon's highly praised customer service that I wouldn't wish on an enemy, (Let's just say it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Worse than the old Compaq Computer. Worse than Packard Bell (remember them). Worst ever!) I am pleased that so far the L1200 with Cingular service works better in every part of my home and city than the 720 with Verizon.I know service varies from place to place and I am certain there are locations where Verizon is better than Cingular, but here and now I am once again experiencing what I expect from a mobile carrier- a good product and good coverage."

The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs.

It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case.

I bought mine around February of 2006 and used it daily until May 2006 when the nub that attaches the case to the belt clip tore out of the leather and would not be reseated. I suppose some a hot glue gun would have made it last a bit longer, but frankly by this point it was looking ""used"" and was not worth repairing. I do not plan to get another as a replacement. I expect a case - even a cheapo case - to last me longer than 3 months.The best part of this case is the tight fit and the magnetic closure. Both ensure that the Sidekick II will never fall out on its own, even if the case somehow becomes inverted. I once spent the better part of the day with my case pointed open-side down and the flap open, and it was held sturdily in place. The case also protects well against the wet, and the various bumps of life."

It is not a palm top computer ... it is not a camera ... it is not an Ipod ... it is not a GPS navigation system ... it is not video player ... it is not an internet access device ... it is not a media storage and playback device ... and it is not a video game player Yup, that's all good. What else? It has good reception. It has excellent voice quality. The battery life is very good, and it has all the features you need to use it as a PHONE. Like what? A one button speakerphone with good sound quality, voice dialing (the good kind which records your voice), the ability to assign individual ring tones to contacts in your phone book, and most beautiful and wonderful and best of all, THE FONT SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 15 YEARS OLD TO READ IT! The clock on the main screen is big and easy to read, and the ring on high is actually loud enough (what a concept!?) The menu and customization features are reasonably comprehensive, and include what you need. In general, this phone is easy to hear, easy to use, easy to see (relative to most others), has clear/clean voice quality, and good reception.The negative?OK, it's not perfect. Reception may not be as good as the very best out there right now. That said, reception and transmission seem as good as most that I've tried, and quite adequate. It isn't tiny. It's about the size of my (lost) LG 6100. It's an inch thick and when the stub antenna is added, 4 inches long. The front screen is difficult to read (Pantech apparently feels that pretty is far more important than functional) and though the front screen is better than most, it could be a lot better (and by that I mean it could be easier to read as opposed to being a color screen with macroscopic font and photo caller ID)What would I change? Well, since it isn't a PDA, camera, GPS, web surfer, Ipod, video game player, it seems like it could be less chunky. An internal antenna, top quality reception/transmission, and a significantly more compact package would be nice. I'd make the front screen high contrast black on white. I like to see an option for black on white display theme (the PN-300 does include a white wallpaper choice ... indicating there is at least one genius at Pantech). A choice for a larger font size and a longer list of ring tones would be useful.Conclusion: I couldn't find any user reviews on this phone, and I was a bit worried that it would be lacking in the features I've used and seen on other current phones. I'm pleasantly surprised with this phone. It is not a stripped down minimalist, make a call only, device. The local Verizon store didn't have the PN-300 and the person I asked about it suggested it was garbage. To that salesperson, who hadn't been shaving long, I'm sure it is. To someone (over 40 crowd?) who doesn't have perfect vision or hearing, and doesn't want their phone to be a tiny personal computer, the PN-300 is an easy to use full featured cell phone, and is easily comparable to most of the current crop of LGs, Motorolas, Samsungs, etc. No, wait ... since the PN-300 does not have all the stuff apparently demanded by the under 30 crowd, it's infinitely better."

Also, I wanted it to protect my phone. This case does that. I like that fact that is fits the phone perfectly; like a glove, and does not hinder usage in any way.Another plus it the fact that the case is clear. This, I don't know if it was intentional, allows for the lights to really reflect off of the case when blinking (messages, bluetooth, etc), making the phone visible and giving it a really cool effect with the top of the case glowing in low to no light situations.The case feels nice on the phone and does not hinder putting the phone in your pocket or anything like that.I don't use the clip that came with the case because I am not one who clips my phone on my belt, but if used, it may be a tad uncomfortable as it is pretty big."

It didnt arrive by the estimated delivery time, so I emailed, and they asked me to wait until the following Monday. So I did, and still no battery! So I emailed again, and all they told me was that they have no control over the USPS, and would send me a new one. So now, I have to wait another 2.5 weeks to maybe not receive a battery again!Since I received the battery from the seller, I have had email after email demanding I remove this negative feedback from their site. I am NOT going to do this. They have badgered me over and over to remove it or, and I quote, ""We've only just begun Steve. If you refuse to act with even a shred of decency or honor, I will make sure you regret it. Remove the negative tonight."" This is the very email I received from SellPhoneStop customer service last night. I could be wrong, but why in the world would I remove my honest opinion if I believe I was given poor customer service?? Obviously, they are beginning to threaten me for my opinion. They really DO NOT care about their customers!! I will never, EVER, order from this company again, and I hope anyone who reads this, won't order from then either."

Plus, it does not hold its charge.","I purchased 2 of these. First of all, the product image is wrong, because the image on Amazon clearly shows the BlackBerry logo, and the batteries I got are unmarked and with no logo or mention of the word BlackBerry.I could have gotten over that if the battery actually worked . . .The batteries are refurbished, and not new. (They were not sealed in plastic.) I put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. The next day I unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. By night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. Note that I did not make a single phone call that day. The phone was on Standby, and it died in 14 hours! My old battery was almost as good!Anyway, I bought two of them, as I said. The second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but I can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of ZERO usage (all on standby).As far as I'm concerned, I was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - I was buying an original BlackBerry product (Note: I have complained about the image to Amazon, so I expect they will take action on this soon)2 - I was buying a new batteryI paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. My guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.Well done, Mr & Mrs Fake-Battery-Seller. You got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again."

I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it.

Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry, I don't think it is. Why? First of all, my Blackberry is only 4 months old, and its original battery is marked ""Made in Japan."" While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked ""Made in China."" Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM. The ""made in China"" label, the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch, unmarked), and most importantly, the inferior performance, all suggest FRAUD. Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most. I would not trust this seller again."

My expectation from the pictures was this stand was rigid, but its not. When I received the order, I was really confused. It was delivered in a flat mail envelope. I was wondering if they sent me the correct item. After opening the package, the stand was flat and needed to be folded at the creases. Once folded correctly, 2 internal magnets keep the stand from unfolding. The only issue I have is my 8310 doesn't fit as snug in the stand as I would like. But it doesn't fall out.

A good amount of time I am in front of a computer but accessing some of the programs on my mobile for a quick reference. It is then that the JAVOedge Cradle for the Treo 680/750 comes in handy.In addition to just propping up the Treo so that I can see when a call comes in, just being able to sync my mobile easily is a lifesaver.The angle of the JAVOedge cradle is good enough to almost be a second working screen. The other thing that makes the cradle nice to work with is just sitting my mobiles off to side but within earshot of an alarm.Of course, the blue light on the cradle is a bit intense, but overall, its a simple and elegant accessory in those times when I am on the go in terms of letting me know my device is being topped of for the next mobile run.And even if you don't ever take this cradle out of your house, it is a better option than just the cables your Treo came with."

When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy."

Cooper,5/5,4.0,1178236800,"Nicely designed, but not real leather","This case appears to be identical to ones sold by Wireless Emporium and AccessoryOne. It also appears virtually identical to the widely lauded Smart Phone Experts P6 case, although it is not clear to me whether the original P6 case had the snap-down interior flap behind which two SD cards may be stored.First things first. The case that I have (and thus, most likely all of the very similar cases I mentioned) is definitely NOT real leather. I am an analytical chemist, so I used reflection IR spectroscopy to determine that the case (including the material wrapping the clip) is actually a polyurethane-based imitation leather. Having said that, the case looks nice and I wasn't expecting real leather in this price range anyway. [Edit: after three months of daily use the case is now showing significant wear at some of the corners (making it obvious that it is actually imitation leather).]I had several concerns about the functionality of this case, but so far I am very happy with it. Here they are:Concern 1: The magnetic flap might come open too easily if snagged on something. First, the two magnets are pretty strong. Second, the receiving surface is recessed a bit, so the flap doesn't stick out very much. Third (and this was a pleasant surprise), the flap springs back closed by itself, especially while it's on your belt--it is actually difficult to force the case to remain in an open position.Concern 2: My Treo (I have a 700wx) might fall out too easily. The case turns out to be fairly snug, with short elastic strips on the sides. I'm not yet sure, but it looks like the elastic might also have enough give to accomodate egrips. I definitely like having access to my ""naked"" Treo. Having the Treo get knocked out of the case is still a theoretical risk, but I think I am much more likely to simply drop it. It is fairly easy to retrieve the 700 from the case without bumping anything I don't want to, but I'd bet this is not true for the 680 or any other model without a protruding antenna.Concern 3: The interior snaps might scratch my Treo. The snaps are actually plastic and their faces are quite flat. Whether I insert the phone with the screen facing in or out, I have not yet noticed a problem. [Edit: after three months of use with the phone facing inward most of this time, there is now indeed a scuff just to the left of the speaker that appears to have come from the snap. Despite this, I still prefer to keep the phone facing in.]Concern 4: The magnets might cause data loss. (Actually, this was never a concern of mine, but I have heard others voice it.) No problem to report. I routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields in lab and I have never had a problem. (Credit cards are another story, however....)Concern 5: The magnets might get pressed into the screen and crack it. The front of the case and the flap actually feel like they have fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside, and the magnets themselves are very flat. With the flap closed there are thus several plies of material between the phone and the outside world. No case is bulletproof, but I feel like this one does a more than adequate job of protecting my Treo, without adding any new risks due to poor design.Concern 6: The clip might come off my belt. Not a problem--it's very stiff. So stiff, in fact, that it takes a little practice to easily slide it over your belt. Also, it doesn't scratch my belts like clamp-style belt clips did (although we'll see how long the imitation leather covering the clip holds up....)Concern 7: I might not like a fixed (non-rotating) clip. The funny thing is that the generic box mine came in has a sticker on it saying ""Premium Horizontal Fitted Pouch w/ Ratcheting Swivel for Palm TREO 650 700w."" Nope--but neither was I expecting one from the product description on this page. It turns out that I wore my prior swivel case in the horizontal position most of the time anyway, and this case sits much closer to my body. It is harder to remove the case completely from my belt (because the clip is so stiff), but this is getting easier with practice.Concern 8: Poor access to connections. You can easily access the headphone jack whether the screen is facing in or out. Either orientation allows access to the volume buttons (after opening the flap) if you want to listen to MP3s. (However, there is no way to conveniently access the 700wx's WMP Play/Pause button, nor to reassign this function to the side button. The best you can do is reassign it to the ""Q"" or ""A"" button, which will be just accessible with the phone in the case, at least with the screen facing out.) However, you cannot charge the phone, connect the synch cable, or access the ringer on/off switch while it is in the case.I hope this helps. This is definitely the best case for my needs, and it was inexpensive to boot! Four of five stars."

The pouch is two separate components glued: the first part is the pouch itself, and the second part is the belt clip. After being happy with my product for 2 months, it spontaneously (not gradually) came apart where the belt clip is inserted into the pouch. A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there. This is a great, space-saving way to store the phone, and I can't say that other pouches have the same defect, but the specific pouch that I purchased was of very poor quality, and almost resulted in me losing the very sensitive information contained on my Treo."

It lasted about eighteen months before the leather around the clip finally began to tear, making the clip's hold on the case tenuous at best. So I gladly bought a replacement.At first glance, the new pouch looks the same. The problem with the clip tearing away from the pouch has been addressed - that part of the case has been reworked and reinforced with a thicker piece of leather - you can now slide the case onto your belt instead of clipping it to your belt.The case seems a little larger that the original - My Treo seems to slide a little from front to back. The interior of the case still has a snapped cover concealing storage compartments for three memory cards. In effect, the case is functionally the same as the original one I had.But you know, I finally figured out why I don't like it. It seems cheaper that the original one. The interior is made out of some kind of fabric and there's a puffy feel to the leather exterior, almost as if the leather is sown on top of a cushion. The original one seems more expensive, more luxurious, by comparison.In short, the case is functional, but its not as good as the original version of this product was.

Duncan ""KzooCollegeAlum""",0/0,2.0,1100131200,More novelty than anything else,"I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed.Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone.But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week."

18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,878,Guy in California,8/13,2.0,1107561600,I pretty much hate this product,"I bought this headset because I used corded earplugs a lot with previous cell phones. But when I bought a new bluetooth cell phone (Sony-Ericsson T610), I bought this because Amazon was offering what sounded like a great deal.Unfortunately, it was a waste of money because I never use the thing. The reasons:1) It doesn't fit my ear (it's too small or maybe just not suited to my ear--it's uncomfortable and always feels like it's going to fall off). The earbud doesn't really get close enough to my ear canal, so even at max volume, the sound is soft, which is OK in a quiet office, but not in a car or outdoors.2) Since it's so uncomfortable, I didn't want to wear it continuously all day long, but if you have the headset linked to the phone, the headset is the ONLY way to answer the cell phone (at least that's how it is with my T610). I had a situation where the phone rang, I hit ""answer"" on the phone and couldn't hear anything through the phone because I had enabled bluetooth. I had to scramble to find the headset. (Since it's wireless, it's hard to see quickly if headset is connected or not.) Enabling/disabling the bluetooth connection is a multi-step process, so it's hard to do in a hurry (with a corded headset, you can quickly just unplug the thing). So since the choice is between ALWAYS using the headset or NEVER using the headset (since disabling and re-enabling bluetooth is a hassle, and you have to remember whether it's on or off to know how to answer the phone), I've chosen to NEVER use it.3) The buttons on the headset mean you can't see them while you use them. There are two multi-functional buttons that are nearly identical in size and shape. Pushing a button briefly does something different from pushing it in longer. So it's easy to hang up on a person when you really want to just mute them. If you use it all the time, I suppose pushing buttons by feel will become natural and so will remembering how long to push each button to do what you want it to do, but beginners and occasional users will probably make a lot of mistakes, as I did."

Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product!

Jabra says they answer your email within 1-2 hours. That hasn't happened for me yet.

18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,327,F. Cardoso,4/4,4.0,1112054400,Great headset and easy paired with the Nokia 6620 !,"The only reason I gave this tiny instrument a 4* rather than a 5* is because of the easy falling nature of this headset. It does not fit tightly onto the ear but just sits loosely on the ear making you feel that it might fall of any time , but not so the case majority of the times.Other than this I have absolutely nothing to complain about. It paired easily with my 6620. The voice and sound clarity is the best you can find. On one instance the person on the other side of the line did indicate the sound clarity was much better when paired with the headset rather than directly talking on the phone . Astonishing !Also the 6620 does give a indicator showing if the bluetooth headset is attached, so when you do press the answer button on the phone, you can expect your your headset to take control. The answer button is on the top of the headset which is satisfactory taking into consideration that its a wireless headset and given the volume control button, there hardly any place to place the answer button. No complains about that. The battery does drain but not as quickly as some have mentioned in their reviews.Looking at some of the neagtive reviews earlier I was very sceptical on buying this, but this headset has proved itself. It does however eat a lot of battery power of the mobile when talking, but that is common for all bluetooth headsets.Previously I did own a Motorola Headset and this one has just proved its a much better headset than any other there in the market.All in all this is a very good headset for the said price."

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight."

Could be a flaw with either the phone's design and/or the Bluetooth specification (I never really did test it with a different phone to verify the problem), but since I am able to receive calls while my PDA is connected to the internet (I have GPRS enabled on my line), it would be nice to be able to answer a call without either talking on my phone or taking the PDA offline. Still, a good starter kit if you don't have any other Bluetooth device paired with your phone.Update: Well, I've managed to get a Motorola V600 and tried the same headset on it, and the same problem persists- you can't connect other Bluetooth devices to the phone while the headset is connected. I am now also fairly certain that the problem is with Bluetooth's specifications as I was unable to exchange pictures between the phones while the PDA was accessing one of the phones. So, okay. No fault of the phones, PDA or the headset. Just the way Bluetooth works in general."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,243,Buz Kindling,5/6,4.0,1113609600,"Possibly the best out there, but one prob with Motorola v551","Very comfortable and fits well, very light-weight, good battery life, great sound quality and volume on both ends of the conversation (unless too windy). I only have one complaint when using the BT250 with my Motorola v551 phone: Every time I turn on the headset to establish the [already paired] link with my phone, the phone immediately goes into voice-dialing mode (i.e., ""Say name now ... say name louder""). Because I usually don't say anything when it does this, the normal harmless result is ""Voice name not found,"" but a few times my phone somehow matched my silence with one of my recorded voice tags, and I found myself disconnecting a call I didn't want to make in the first place.This did not happen when I used my v551 with a Logitech bluetooth headset (which did not fit me well, causing me not to be able to hear the speaker most of the time).Jabra support first told me to pair the headset to the phone again, this time using the alternate method for phones that support the hands-free profile. This did result in a few enhanced features, but it didn't stop the unwanted voice-dialing. My next email from Jabra support said that this ""is normal behavior when you hold the answer/end button on the headset,"" and they suggested that I either turn voice dialing off on my phone, or use the phone (instead of the headset) to disconnect the link between the two units. Well, there is only one place I can find on the v551 for turning off voice dialing (under the ""headset"" options), but this doesn't stop the irritating problem. Using the phone to disconnect and re-establish the link is much less convenient. It DOES stop the problem, however, but only if the headset remains turned on (but disconnected) the whole time, adversely affecting battery life. If I disconnect using the phone, then turn the headset off, the voice-dialing thing will happen when I try to re-establish the link, even if I try to do it from the phone just before turning the headset on (which doesn't work anyway).I must say again, in spite of the above, this is truly a great headset. I'm pretty sure (from other reviews) that the problem I have does not affect most phones, and it is primarily just an irritant that I have grown used to, and it only occurs once each time I turn the headset on in order to establish the link."

Stone,7/9,2.0,1110326400,By far better than I thought,"My wife wanted one of the new Bluetooth phones, and of course that meant her hands free car kit would no longer work. So the choice was to buy her a cordless hands free headset or another several hundred to install a new car kit. After a protracted review process, I chose the Jabra 250 as it seemed to be the most comfortable to wear and it seemed to have the best volume incoming and outgoing as well from what we looked at on the market, even though it is only using Bluetooth 1.1. Now that we bought it, I'm blown away, this unit is truly amazing. We are using it on the new Moto MPx 220 and it works like a champ. You hardly notice that you are even wearing it, and it has enough incoming volume to blow you away if you don't turn it down. Outgoing volume is good as well. The unit would have received a 5 star rating if it was using Bluetooth 1.2. What I have determined after reading many reviews that were great and those that said the unit was not very good, is that I tend to believe it has to do with the phone it is matched up to. A new high quality phone should work great with this as it does for us. Hope this helps and thanks for all the reviews I was able to read to get me to this point."

It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,154,Gregory A. Tarallo,2/2,2.0,1122595200,Poor reception. Poor range,"I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS:1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet.2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time.3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out.4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it.5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear.All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating.If you buy this...keep your receipt handy."

It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,169,William Reading,4/5,4.0,1109980800,Not bad at all,"I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15"" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,325,"M K ""Sterling""",19/19,4.0,1102377600,It does what it says ...well for the most part.,"I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life.

I had a BT200 before this one. Other than the color difference, I asked what is so different? Upon making my first call with the headset, I immmediately noticed how the transfer of the call from my P900 to the BT250 was almost instantaneous. The reception and clarity of the headset is clear and the connection time is quick. The adjustment time for the user to get used to this device is minimal. Just remember to answer your call by hitting the headset power button quickly. The headset has plenty of charge time to last throughout the day.Weaknesses:One weakness is that you should not use it outside when wind is present. However, this fault is not due to the headset itself. Another weakeness is that the holder of the BT250 needs improvement. I kept the device in my pocket without losing it. Within two days of starting to use the holder with the belt clip, I almost lost the BT250. Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps to locate it outside my car. Use great caution and be aware of your BT250 if you use the holder on your belt. If you sit down, the holder can easily can easily push the BT250 loose from the holder.Summary:With this headset, you can say goodbye to wires forever. Once you have a truly wireless headset, you will not want to go back to wires. The BT250 quickly connects to the phone, is clear and static free, and is relatively simple to use. Other than the holder of this BT250, you will enjoy this headset."

No mention of this, but I have figured out how the device can be opened (there is one tiny screw) and will come to it when the batteries do die. Batteries seem to last many hours - I haven't tested exactly how long.No warning before batteries die. You can be cut off in the middle of a conversation. Some warning beeps would have been nice.I've paired it in the ""enhanced"" mode with the sony t610 - works just fine if you bother to read the manual and undertake enhanced pairing. You will get problems others mention if you do regular pairing. There are some glitches but those are on the phone side (I can't hear the beep before I voice dial if I am using the headset). Voice dialling does not work in a noisy environment - but that is not the headsets fault. It works well otherwise. Nothing to complain - all features mentioned work and do so well.The Sony T610 phone has very limited range with this headset. However, this is a phone issue.

I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk. If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically. In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket. If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is ""connected"" (from Activesync's perspective). You will hear a constant ""crackling"" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn. It took me a while to figure out. You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just ""disconnect"" the BT session temporarily while talking. This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure. The ""hanging"" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear. There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help. This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another. Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.

This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up."

Bryant,0/0,4.0,1189382400,A Perfect Fit,"I purchased this headset because I was having trouble hearing with the Motorola set I got with my phone. The headset was a snap to set-up, and it is extremely comfortable to wear. My old Motorola set had a tendency to flop around while the Jabra sits comfortably on my ear. Unlike the Motorola, the Jabra's speaker is designed to fit in the ear, which makes it much easier to hear. It comes with two sizes of ear gels, but even with the large gel, I have to lightly press it into my ear during a conversation in order to achieve optimum volume. It's range also seems to be a little limited, but all and all it's a marked improvement over the Motorola headset."

I've had occassion to use it myself (when I have to use her phone) so I feel that I can confidently rate it.Overall, it isn't too bad for a handsfree. There are times when I call her (even on a land line) and it sounds like she's digitally stuttering. In my opinion; not good. It's realatively light weight and you can wear it for a long period of time without alot of discomfort (she does wear it quite often during the day). The different ear pieces give you the ability to give a custom fit feel to it, which is nice. I've read in some of the other reviews for the bt250v (a similar model) that it has a tendency to fall off if you move your head too quickly; I can see why.Truth be told, I almost purchased one of these for my own cell phone use (I own a Motorola v360) but I read the reviews for the Plantronics Voyager PLT 510. :) I'm glad I did - but that's another review."

18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,895,Phillip Anglin,8/9,2.0,1103328000,FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great,"I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the ""wired"" headset."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,567,Kaushik Lodh,53/71,4.0,1112400000,Overall Good. Read carefully.,"Hello,I am a scientist in the field of Microwave/RF circuits and systems. I considered several but finally chose the Jabra A210 along with the BT250 Jabra headset. This review is for both items together.A few things to note:1) swithcing on and off is not very intuitive for the BT250, you have to hold down the power button for ""n"" number of seconds, the lights will flash in a certain pre-ordained sequence, but if you do hold down the power button more than what is required (this is sketchy), then the appliances enter set up mode, and the pairing between the adapter and the headset might be lost. The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit. So its pairing is not affected by the power button. BUT this set (headset and the adapter) have 8 hours talk time and 240 hours standby time (as per manufacturer's claim), even if it performs up to 80% of the reported claim, you wont have to mess around too much with the power switch. You can comfortably use it during the day and come home at night and recharge the set.2) Quality of sent and received signals. Please note: The jabra A210 has a pin which can be put in to 3 settings. Setting # 1 is for motorola phones, Setting # 3 for all other phones and Setting # 2 is for when you feel discomfort in setting # 1 or # 3. I have a LG VX 6100 NON-BLUETOOTH phone from verizon. I tested the settings extensively by calling a friend. (Thanks Guddu.) I tried setting # 1, there were 2 noticeable problems: (a) My friend complained that the volume of my voice was low, but the clarity was good.(b) I could not use the button on the head set to connect and disconnect calls.But I must mention, I could receive my friend's voice in absolutely loud and clear tones.Both the problems were alleviated when I used setting # 3 on the adapter. In fact, when I started using setting # 3, my friend complained that my voice was too loud! There werent any issues related to clarity.3) Range: The manufacturer claims this to have a range of 10 meters (30 feet). But at the same time, in its manual, it is written that if there are objects in the wireless signal path between the adapter and the headset, the sound quality will suffer.Now we have to consider 2 trade offs for every RF design. (a) power (b) size. We all want the smallest devices with maximum power and range. Well physics and electronics sharply put us back in our places. If you want greater range, you need to put out signal with great field strength. That needs higher battery consumption, high efficiency non linear amplifiers and large antennas. Microstrip patch antennas (generally used for their low profiles and small size) resonate to a particular frequency if their length is correctly defined. But with design modifications, this length can be shortened, but the gain suffers. Also, thanks to the FCC, we have very strict limitations on the frequency bands available (the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave length, and thus smaller the antenna and consequently higher the gain). FCC makes many RF devices work at lower frequencies than we RF engineers would like them to operate at. Also, due to fear of signal from one device interferring with other devices, FCC puts limits on the amount of power a device can put out.Given these considerations, the A210 and BT250 which are required to have excellent power efficiency (8 hours talk time and 240 hours stand by time) and also small and compact size (very small batteries and small antennas) provide a range which is not quite satisfactory. I walked at a radius of 10 feet and even with walls, metal partitions, etc, the signal strength was not that affected. How ever more than 10 feet, the signal had so much noise in it, I had to move closer to the adapter.To be honest with you, I am not happy with the range. I dont think the range is $130 worth (for the adapter and headset = $50 + $80). Period. For a 10 feet range the cost should have been more like $50 (for both).So basically, we have reviewed some basic factors. However, there is one major design flaw that I would like to bring to your attention. That is: The head set and the adapter enter in to stand by mode after one minute of non-usage. So even when you are in the middle of a call and both parties keep silent for more than a minute, the head set and the adapter stop communicating. The call is NOT disconnected. You can either pull the adapter jack out of the cell phone and put it back in, or press the volume key on the cell phone (basically do some thing with the cell phone) and you will be able to resume the conversation on the bluetooth devices. How ever this is not voice operable. Meaning, if the adapter and the headset enter in to stand by mode during the conversation when both parties to the call are silent, even when they both start talking, the adapter and the head set do not start communicating.This is extremely uncomfortable. If I have a blue tooth head set and adapter kit for which I have paid $130 or more, then I want absolute mobility with out any reason to come back to the adpater unless I do so from my own free will.Lastly, here is a recommendation for the people who designed this set. You need to incorporate greater features in to this adapter and head set. It should be able to not only handle voice data but also music and other types of audio information. This means you might need to use a more efficient method of modulation. Maybe you are using FSK which is constant envelope modulation (I deal with military and radar communication, so I dont know what modulation is used for blue tooth), but you cannot include too much information in to the FSK signal. Try using QAM, maybe not a very high order QAM, but some thing capable of handling all audio information. All you will need to change in the design is: a new power amplifier which is high efficiency and linear. Probably a class E or Class F with feed forward or Envelope elimination and restoration (Kahn) or Doherty principles. It is simple. You will need a one time engineering development cost, but in the long term - with market domination and mass production, it will more than make up for it.As for buyers. If you are rich, a techno geek or a business person constantly on the phone - Go for this. It is good.But if you have limited resources (money) then buy a simple wired hands free kit. In fact at times when the battery is down or I have to move to get back within range, I long for the reliability of a wired handsfree kit.Update: June 25th, 2005: By the way, I lost one A210 and recently purchased one more. I tried one more test on it recently. I got a adapter from radio shack (Part # 274-397) which accepts 3/32"" submini stereo plug ( as is the plug of the A210) and fits a 1/8"" mini stereo jack (as is the plug for all standard head phone jacks). Thus I connected the A210 to the adapter and connected to my new Creative MuVo MP3 player. Then put on my BT250. It worked!! I could hear the music through the blue tooth set up!BUT the music quality was poor... this blue tooth unit probably has enough sampling rate for speech, it is not able to handle the sudden and faster changes in amplitude, phase and frequency of a music signal.Nevertheless it works.Kaushik."

While I realize this hardly makes me an expert or a Bluetooth elite, I am not that enthused with this headset.In the first place, the general feeling I get when handling it, is that it is of marginal construction and ""quality"" was, perhaps, sacrificed to get a unit out on the market.While I will say that it is very comfortable to wear, it fails in one major area - that of ""user"" volume. I am forever being told that I cannot be heard or that my audio is so low as to be almost a whisper. I didn't buy a headset so I could stand in the corner and yell into my phone; I've seen enough of these ""ego heads"" doing that in airports and restaurants; talking so loud as though everyone should be interested in their conversation.So I am actively looking again. Maybe the thing to do is just to wait it out and see if SOMEONE can't come up with a headset that is comfortable to wear that actually performs as it says it will."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,33,Michael Beatrice,5/5,3.0,1113955200,So far not a big fan.,"First, I'm totally willing to plead user error (but I don't think so). I bought this item because of CNET's high marks. After successfully pairing it, I found in the manual there were special pairing instructions for my phone (T-610) to get extra features. Since re-pairing it, I no longer get a voice activation prompt and have to guess when to say my contact name.Also, the manual specifies that wireless networks will interfere with Jabra's reception and cause popping. Thank goodness there aren't any of those around! Seriously, these days every Starbucks on the planet has a wireless network up and running.But my biggest gripe is the inoperable voice dialing. I get ""no match"" after ""no match."" My guess is that the ambient noise when you record your voice names has to match up with the ambient noise when you make the handsfree call. (i.e. the interior of my car sounds different than my office or living room).Finally, my email to Jabra tech support has gone unanswered (24 hours).I'm still keeping my fingers crossed and will happily edit this review should things work out better. I'm going to try resetting and re-pairing."

I have a wireless network at home which seemed to cause a lot of interference with my headset. Even when I tried the headset on the road or elsewhere, the static was unbearable.

My main complaint is it is not adjustable to my ear. I actually have to use the big ear gel to get it to stay on because the part that goes over your hear is about 1 cm too high over my ear, so the big ear gel holds it up....

I bought it for my T-Mobile telephone and while pairing was easy, when walking down the street the microphone seems to act like a wind tunnel - wind just blows straight into the microphone and no one can hear me over the combination of street noise and wind.I don't think it is a T-Mobile GSM issue although the microphones on their handsets seem to be so super sensitive that listeners often say they can hear my footsteps and the conversations of others around me better than they can hear me.Overall, not very workable and I'm disappointed. Have actually just ordered a Plantronics M3500 which boasts a noise-canceling microphone. We'll see if there is any improvement.Finally, I thought that at least I'd be able to use this headset for Skpye. It works a charm on my Mac although people say I'm faint, but on my Windows machine I am completely unable to get the sound to come out of the Jabra earpiece; only through the speakers on my computer. While that is better I think than having to listen to a telephone conversation through stereo headphones (which, incidentally, is unbearable and cuts you off from everything going on around you), it is not perfect."

The distance from your headset to the cell was definitely short range, maybe a few feet away before it got fuzzy. What was worse is that after 4 months of owning it, the earpiece (that holds the rubber plug) broke off and the headset surface started fading. The piece breaking off meant I could not put a earplug on there and it was not covered in the warranty (the customer service suggested I super glue it!) I bought another Jabra thinking the last one was a fluke...but other things started falling apart. Very poor quality piece...I would rethink buying this product!"

18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,799,Just Cid,9/9,4.0,1101945600,Best BT headset I've ever owned!,"I bought this headset after having a Nokia HDW-2 headset for about a year, before its battery went south.Did my research, thought this one was the best of the lot.Found out I was nearly right. This is *much* better than the HDW-2. Very little static, doesn't drop calls. Haven't found the limits of the battery (yet), and I've used it in standby mode for nearly 8 hours straight. Works well with the Nokia 3650, including the voice dialing.My talk times are not that long, so I haven't stressed the talk limits yet.As to cons, the only con I've found so far is with fit. The smaller earpiece of those supplied still irritates my ear after a few hours of wearing (on the right ear). Wearing it on the left ear doesn't seem to get as raw, but the piece doesn't fit as well (yes, I've turned the ear-bead the correct way!). However, I take the piece off for a few minutes rest and I'm back in business. Or I move it to the left side for a while.Only other drawback is that I have to turn the Bt250 off before I can use my Bluetooth on my Palm Pilot with the phone. I guess its only one bluetooth device at a time.Charging is easy. Pairing with my Nokia 3650 was a snap.Is it a toy? Yes, like all technology that doesn't keep you alive, its a toy.If you want a wireless headset, I think this is the one for the moment."

It may be a function of the Treo's Bluetooth capabilities so keep that in mind and do not waste your money on this headset if you are using a Treo.It has very poor range; arm's length at best. Outdoors it is useless. It has times when it will refuse to pick up a call. The voice quality is also poor with hissing and crackling. The only place it seems to be remotely useful is in the car where it is within arm's reach and the hissing is only moderate. This is pretty expensive to only be able to use part of the time.

I've been using this for about 18months now and have generally had no problems. I think bluetooth handsfree kits in general are worth the money over the wired ones as they give you true hands free that works (doesn't fall out of your ear when you turn your head while driving). The Jabra in particular is far better design than any others on the market at the moment because by design its more likely to fit different ear and head shapes. Also the in-ear design means you have the best chance of hearing the other party clearly. And I have never not been able to hear the other person. Setup is easy and takes about 2min. Day to day operation is simple, you just turn it on and it works.There are 2 reasons why I have only give this a 4 star rating.1) Some time it doesn't connect with my T68i after having been out of range (but to be fair I think this is more the crappy T68i than the Jabra)2) When outdoors it isn't very good at cutting out background noise so the person on the other end can't hear me verywell (NOTE: this is ONLY when i'm outdoors. Indoors or in a car while moving is perfect)One of my mates has one too so I know what its like being on the receiving end of a conversation and its fine."

Gonczi ""CompuGeek""",18/21,2.0,1096675200,"Neat concept, imperfect implementation","I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.I second other reviewers regarding poor range. The phone has to be in line of sight, within a few feet. If the phone is in mypant pocket, reception is marginal.Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.When I am voice dialing a phone book entry with multiple numbers,I do not get any audio feedback that the phone is waiting for meto say(e.g) ""home"" or ""work"" to select one of the numbers.I find it pratically unusable for voice dialing while driving.I guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the Jabra which seems to beout (see above).Oh by the way, the phone uses battery power at a much faster ratewhen connected to the headset, i.e enabling bluetooth increasespower consumption."

Cowart ""Tmortn""",11/12,4.0,1108080000,Slick new toy,"SetupNokia 6820Laptop using Linksys usbbt100 adaptorWith the phone it is a nice handsfree option. In response to the guy that had such a hard time turning the bluetooth connection on and off you can just turn the unit off by holding the button for a few seconds.If your phone supports the more enhanced call management features You probably want to answer the call first since holding it down while the phone is ringing rejects the call. Then while the call is in progress it just places the call on hold and continuing to hold will turn the device off and the phone will revert to standard usage with the call on hold.Additionally many phones, especially those with Bluetooth, have the ability to define user shortcuts to phone features. One setup to minimize the hassel of connecting and disconnecting BT devices would be very handy since the BT menus are normally several menue options deep.Really though this is a headset for someone intrested in constant wear. I highly recommend getting this or any handsfree set to fit your comfort level because if in the end the fit is uncomfy your going to have a pricey doo dad.Range is less than 30 feet but that seems pretty standard for a headset phone combination. Both are trying to maximize battery life and the antennas are not optimally placed. 10 feet is a good rule of thumb unless you have a particuarly bad combination. With the Nokia 6820 I seem to have a comfortable range of about 15 feet. However with the Linksys blue tooth adaptor on my laptop I can walk all over my house and even to my mailbox. Somewhere on the order of 60-100 feet. Very handy if you are a voice chat user or want a quiet discreet source of music without wires at work that dosn't completely obscure your hearing.Also if anyone is wondering the battery is Lithium Ion polymer so there should be no concern over any memory affect if you want to charge up before a full discharge. However the battery is intenal and there does not seem to be any real option for replacement. So you can only expect a life of around 400-500 charge cycles. At once a week that is a good while. At once a day you might as well just call it a year, perhaps less. It will still be working but if you are using it that hard you will also be far more aware of the slow degredation over time.Gave it four instead of 5 for the potential problem of a short usefull life due to the battery and because the fit is not for everyone. Deffinatly something to put your hands on before laying down the money if possible."

It has excellent battrey life as advertised and fits in the ear perfectly. I use it while I'm at the gym on the belt even. It comes with spare ear-pieces with different sizes. The sound quality is excellent and loud. It supports advanced headset mode too. A belt clip can be attached to the charger to carry it on your belt. Price is ok too. I use it with Nokia 6600 by the way. It is right ear, left ear switchable.Other bluetooth headsets are wheather weak (the ear-hanger breaks) or have short-life batteries. So look for these factors before buying any headset."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,187,Amy Jo Arrant,7/7,4.0,1107475200,Pretty good product,I just bought the Jabra BT250 and have only been using it for about a week now. It has a bit of delay when you answer or place a call but it is tolerable. I have always had a very hard time finding earphones that fit me and will stay in my ear (from cell phone earbuds to mp3 players). This fits very securly and comfortably. Easily could forget I have it on. Have only gone about 20 feet from my phone but the phone was in my car with the door closed and I walked to get the mail... I did get a bit of static but perfectly usable. Occasionally I try to place a call and the Jabra doesn't seem to make the connection and I end up using the phone itself. But this has only happened less than 5% of the calls I've made. Easy to put on with one hand...while driving.Overall I'd say good buy only negative that I see so far is the occasional time when I can't get the Jabra to click on and receive the call.
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,556,"Timothy L. Brown ""TLB""",12/14,3.0,1114387200,Poor belt clip design,"I don't have much to say about the 250 other than to point out the really poor design of the belt clip/charger. The 250 is supposed to click into this holder (which connects to the power adaptor for charging). This holder is designed to clip onto your belt so that you can carry the 250 when is is not in use. Okay, I agree that you will look extremely nerdy if you have your phone AND your earpiece hanging from your belt but sometimes you need to put the things away and the Freespeak 250 is really too fragile to carry in your pocket. The only problem with this is that the 250 will easily fall out of the holder and if you use it you WILL lose it. It is only a matter of time. My 250 lasted about 45 seconds and when I went to get it from the belt clip it was GONE. Not the holder but the 250 itself. Some lucky stiff at the Houston airport picked it up and walked away.I also thought that the 250 was not well made. When I would push the on/off or volume buttons I could feel the housing ""give"" a little, as if the buttons were about to collapse into the housing. A little too flimsy and not indication of a long life expectancy for the earpiece.I suggest that you consider another alternative - at $90 the 250 is simply overpriced."
18,Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset,unknown,566,Papabear075,6/6,4.0,1128470400,Great headset,"I have read a lot of reviews for this and the Motorolla headset. While I have never used the Motorolla one I like this one better because no one notices it in my ear. The reception is great, the sound is clear, and no one has complained they couldn't hear me. I have had it for a month with no problems. The only issue I have is when I am near corless phones or wireless networks I have to hold the phone closer to the headset. However when I am at the mall or in the park I do not need to take my phone out of it's case. All in all this is a great headset."

Jabra makes a different version which looks identical to the BT250 but is designed specifically for use with the Treo 650 and can be purchased at PalmOne's website. DO NOT BUY THE BT250 for the TREO 650. Go to www.palmone.com and buy it there - they are two different devices and the BT250 is severly limited in functionality when paired with the Treo 650.

My main gripe has been the need to constantly clean the screen. I initially bought one of the mini stylus to try out and have since ordered a couple more for co workers. The quality is very good and the plug that fits the headphone port is perfect.My only disclaimer is that I use it as a pointer. I'm not trying to do handwriting or drawing on the iPad. It may be fine for those applications but that's not my thing. Like the iPad it is a simple design that just works.

Works ok but keep in mind it is small. I have a small lowepro camera case that holds my ipod tuch 4 and its Belkin grip edge case quite handy for active transport and protection with belt velcro loop attatchment (very secure). If I slide my ipod into the case with the stylus connected to the earjack port it fits in no problem. You CANNOT reach the entire ipod screen when this is connected to the earjack. You get most of it but for the area near the top you need to pull it out from the jack port. Somewhat of a hassle.

I ordered this and the box wave Stylus/ink pen. My original review was 4 stars; however, in the last weeks of ownership, I've lost at least 1 black ring from each item! The small black lines you see are actually black really thin and cheap O rings. They make for a comfortable and stylish pen and mini; however, when they fall off and you lose them, it becomes an uncomfortable and ugly Stylus and min! I lost the first one of each before I even noticed the rings move easily! After being aware that I must use caution, I lost another. I'd like them to send me quiet a few spares for each item. But as it is, I can't give this product a good review. I would not order another box wave product knowing about the temporary rings!! It's upsetting!"

In winter, when you've got gloves on -- nothing better. Also like the larger model, it attaches to your mobile device with a plug that fits in the 3.5mm audio jack. This little nub stores neatly in a small case with the phone, but its short stature makes it a bit uncomfortable for extended use: finger cramps ahoy! PDApanache and other makers offered telescoping barrels that solved the ""almost-gone piece of chalk"" syndrome, I'd give a fifth star if this stylus extended in length. But it's still a great tool for keeping your smartphone or tablet screen clean, and is probably more accurate than your finger for ""touch typing"" an on-screen. For the (current) price, I think it's a quite a bargain."

About 4 months later he called me up and said he wanted 2 more ordered because he wanted to keep it for himself but both my sister and my mother also wanted it. He said it is helpful for entering information on his phone because his fingers are ""large and dry"" and sometimes his phone doesn't seem to know he's trying to touch things on the screen. I saw a review about it not working with the Nook Color however my mother uses hers with her Nook Color as well as her phone. She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook. I have one and it works fine on my phone and iPad. The mini size is good for keeping it with us when we are not at home.
