# ALS-algorithm-adaptation-spark

This is the final project (ongoing) for my Database Management class at Ecole Polytechnique (MSc Data Science, 2019-2020).
I worked with 2 classmates ([Tommy Tran](https://github.com/TommyTranX) and Constantin Vodé) to implement the Alternating Least Square (ALS) Matrix Factorization algorithm (used for recommender systems) with Spark.

We started from the paper **"Fast Matrix Factorization for Online Recommendation with Implicit Feedback" (X.He, H.Zhang, M.Kan, T.Chua, National University of Singapore, 2017)**, which you can find in this repository.

The paper shows that ALS algorithm can be easily parallelized, but no MR implementation is provided. Our work consisted in developing a Spark version of the algorithm and performing experimental analysis on one of the datasets used by the paper.
